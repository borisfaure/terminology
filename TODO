here's a short list of things i think we can do in the short to medium term to
make it a first-class terminal:

[ ] splits need to size only by steps in font size (elm feature)
[ ] split handles need to become invisible (elm theme)
[ ] better info in tyls -m
[ ] tyls -b needs doing
[ ] blink and blink2 attributes need to be supported
[ ] general input mode handling improvements (keypad, other key
    input, etc.)
[ ] selection of background "wallpapers" (and support them at all -
    doesn't right now - should support regular images, animated gifs,
    and edje files)
[ ] scrollbar (elm scroller that mirrors the term smart size/position
    - gives us fingerscroll - layer on top of term smart, stick
    invisible rect inside to track for scrolling etc.)
[ ] selection mode mirrors entry style for touch displays (handle
    on_hold flags, etc.)
[ ] selection off edge scrolls in that direction (as per selection
    mode too if it gets NEAR an edge)
[ ] selection should have nice visible handles on the start/end so u can
    drag and change its size once there
[ ] improve selection text extraction logic so its reliable
[ ] fast text/regex searching similar to urxvt
[ ] search in terminal (and keep highlighting until search cleared)
[ ] logging of terminal to file
[ ] number recognition with base conversion
[ ] dnd of file to term offer to paste path, with escapes or paste file
    content (if text) with or without escaping
[ ] helpers when executed need to escape path/uri in command buffer
[ ] media - improve position slider to track position as u play
[ ] improve look of meida controls (youtube like better with mouse move show)
[ ] make media controls an api where controls are provided by the media
    object owner so they can be custom placed/swallowed/handled better
[ ] media controls need to have zoom controls for all formats
[ ] media controls need next/prev page controls for paged media (ps/pdf)
[ ] add better handling of music files (with just playbar+vol, no image)
[ ] display queue of media visually
[ ] add option for cjk double width mode
[ ] apparently there are problems with mutt, screen and tmux? vim
    mousewheel scroll suport doesnt work
[ ] possible evas font problem with proggy fonts: http://www.proggyfonts.com/
[ ] need mouse control for sel object (autoscroll based on position)
[ ] need mouseover top of term to go into sel mode
[ ] need to track bell on bg terms and indicate a bg term wants attention

things in future to make it totally kick-butt:

[ ] maybe want a new sel width that slides/fades in on mouseover on top
    that lists miniature thumbs like current sel does but in a linear
    way along the top
[ ] reflow text on resize
[ ] track child process stats like cwd etc. and when launching a new
    "tab" or shell use the last child process cwd to put the shell
    into
[ ] track mem and iowait and cpu stats for child procs and their
    children and display them as little overlays in the terminal so u
    know if your "grep -r /" is cpu or io bound and what is eating up
    all your cpu cycles or causing a tonne of hdd interrupts etc. -
    send results of these stats to theme with messages much like
    cpufreq, battery etc. do in e17 so theme can display as bars,
    dials or anything it likes (text, led's etc. too).
[ ] remember tile layouts and be able to restore them and at least as
    much of child processes as the term can manage reasonably reliably
[ ] split it out into a library - maybe just as part of elementary and
    make a terminal widget where you can specify your own read/write
    funcs for the term fd etc. so u can make a custom bit of code that
    uses the terminal widget as if it were stdin/out but just as
    loopback within the app (ie don't exec process - just create pty
    and offer read/write to/from it)
