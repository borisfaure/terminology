******************************************************************************

Requirements:
-------------

  * efl (>= 1.8.0)
  * elementary (>= 1.8.0)

Please note that some features may not quite function correctly or
completely on EFL 1.8. Newer versions would be better.

Please see http://www.enlightenment.org for information on these.

This is an EFL terminal emulator with some extra bells and whistles.

Compiling:
----------

Once you have met requirements, compiling and installing is simple:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

Note: to make terminology work with input methods in general you need:

export ECORE_IMF_MODULE="xim"
export XMODIFIERS="@im=none"

Default key controls:

Shift+PgUp = Scroll 1 page up
Shift+PgDn = Scroll 1 page down
Shift+Up = Scroll 1 line up
Shift+Down = Scroll 1 line down
Shift+Insert = Paste Clipboard (ctrl+v/c) selection
Shift+Ctrl+Insert = Paste Primary (highlight) selection
Shift+Keypad-Plus = Font size up 1
Shift+Keypad-Minus = Font size down 1
Shift+Keypad-Multiply = Reset font size
Shift+Keypad-Divide = Copy highlight to Clipboard (same as ctrl+c in gui apps)
Ctrl+PgUp = switch focus to previous terminal inside a window
Ctrl+PgDn = switch focus to next terminal inside a window
Ctrl+Shift+t = create new terminal on top of current inside window (tabs)
Ctrl+Shift+h = toggle displaying the miniview of the history
Ctrl+Shift+Home = bring up "tab" switcher
Ctrl+Shift+PgUp = split terminal horizontally (1 term above the other)
Ctrl+Shift+PgDn = split terminal vertically (1 term to the left of the other)
Ctrl+Shift+c = copy current selection to clipboard
Ctrl+Shift+v = paste current clipboard selection
Alt+Home = Enter command mode (enter commands to control terminology itself)
Alt+Return = Paste primary selection
Alt+w = Copy selection to primary
Ctrl+Alt+Equal = Font size up 1
Ctrl+Alt+Minus = Font size down 1
Ctrl+Alt+0 = Reset font size
Ctrl+Alt+9 = Big font size
Ctrl+1 = switch to terminal tab 1
Ctrl+2 = switch to terminal tab 2
Ctrl+3 = switch to terminal tab 3
Ctrl+4 = switch to terminal tab 4
Ctrl+5 = switch to terminal tab 5
Ctrl+6 = switch to terminal tab 6
Ctrl+7 = switch to terminal tab 7
Ctrl+8 = switch to terminal tab 8
Ctrl+9 = switch to terminal tab 9

Command mode commands currently understood:

f = Reset font to default setting saved in config
f+ = Increase fontsize
f- = Decrease fontsize
fb = Display big font size (10x20 bitmap, or size 20 with scalable).
gNxM = make terminal NxM chars in size (if possible). e.g. g80x48 g40x20.
       If just one number is provided, it will use the following shortcuts:
       g0=80x24; g1=80x40; g2=80x60; g3=80x80; g4=120x24; g5=120x40; g6=120x60;
       g7=120x80; g8=120x120
b = reset the background (no media)
bPATH = set the background media to an absolute file PATH

Mouse controls:

Right mouse button = controls menu
Middle mouse button = paste highlight selection
Left mouse button/drag = make highlight
Wheel = scroll up or down in history
Ctrl+Wheel = zoom font size up/down
Ctrl+Left mouse button/drag = make block selection highlight

Extended escapes for terminology only:

[\033][}][COMMAND][\000]
i.e.
  1.   ESC char (\033 or 0x1b)
  2.   } char
  3... sequence of UTF8 chars other than nul (\000 or 0x00).
  4    \000 char (nul byte or 0x00 to indicate end of sequence)
e.g.
  echo -n '\033}Hello world\000'
  
Commands:

any values inside square brackets [] are to be replaced by some
content (numbers, strings, paths, url's etc.). example:

aa[PATH-OF-FILE] should become something like:
  aa/tmp/file.png
or aa[true/false] should become something like:
  aatrue
or
  aafalse

Themes:

Themes can be stored in ~/.config/terminology/themes/ .

---

pn[FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
  = popup the given media file/url now

pq[FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
  = queue a popup for the given media file/url

bt[FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
  = set the terminal background media file/url temporarily

bp[FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
  = set the terminal background media file/url permanently

at[on/true/yes/off/false/no]
  = set the terminal alpha state to be on, or off temporarily

ap[on/true/yes/off/false/no]
  = set the terminal alpha state to be on, or off permanently

qs
  = query grid and font size. stdin will have written to it:
    W;H;FW;FH\n
    where W is the width of the terminal grid in characters
    where H is the height of the terminal grid in characters
    where FW is the width of 1 character cell in pixels
    where FH is the height of 1 character cell in pixels

is[CW;H;FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
  = insert STRETCHED media (where image will stretch to fill the cell area)
    and define expected cell area to be W cells wide and H cells high,
    with the image/media/url.
    where C is the replace character to be identified in later text
    where W is the width in character cells (up to 511).
    where H is the height in character cells (up to 511).
    
    note that this escape alone has no effect. it indicates a future
    intention of inserting media into the terminal. the terminal will
    EXPECT a grid of WxH "replace characters" to follow, with each
    sequence of such replace characters beginning with a 'ib' escape command
    and ending with an 'ie' escape command.
    
    the FULL-PATH-OR-URL for all  the i commands (is, ic, if, it) may
    be of the form:
    
      /full/path/to/file.png
    
    OR
    
      /full/path/to/link\n/full/path/to/file.png
      
      where a newline character separates a URI for a link and a full
      path to a file to display in the region. the link is the
      destination URI when a user may click on the given media image.
    
    example:
    
      printf("\033}is#5;3;%s\000"
             "\033}ib\000#####\033}ie\000\n"
             "\033}ib\000#####\033}ie\000\n"
             "\033}ib\000#####\033}ie\000\n", "/tmp/icon.png");
    
    note that '#' is the replace character, and later '#' chars if inside
    begin/end escapes, will be replaced by the given media indicated
    in the insert media escape.

ic[CW;H;FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
  = insert CENTERED media (centered in cell area). otherwise parameters are
    identical to the "is" command, but retains aspect and is padded by
    blank space.

if[CW;H;FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
  = insert FILLED media (fill in cell area). otherwise parameters are
    identical to the "is" command but ensures the entire area is
    filled like a background even if media goes beyond cell bounds and is
    clipped.

it[CW;H;FULL-PATH-OR-URL]
  = insert THUMB media (thumbnail cell area). otherwise parameters are
    identical to the "is" command, but uses thumbnail generation to
    make a fast to load but low resolution version (cached) of the media.

it[CW;H;LINK\nFULL-PATH-OR-URL]
  = insert THUMB media (thumbnail cell area). otherwise parameters are
    identical to the "is" command, but uses thumbnail generation to
    make a fast to load but low resolution version (cached) of the media.
    LINK is a path (or url) to open WHEN the thumb is clicked on by the
    user.

ij[CW;H;FULL-PATH\nGROUP][\n][cmd1][\r\n][cmd2]...
  = insert EDJE object with file path given, and the group name given.
    the command list (and the \n whitespace delimiter before the list)
    is optional, but is executed/parsed before display of the actual
    object to do things like initialize its initial state. see "iC"
    command for more details on the command list.

    be aware that once you have an object with an assigned channel id,
    it can send back signals and messages via escapes on stdin. these
    escapes will follow terminology extended escape format
    (ESC + } ... \000), and the content will be one of:

      ;CHID\ndrag\nPART NAME\nVAL1\nVAL2
      ;CHID\ndrag,start\nPART NAME\nVAL1\nVAL2
      ;CHID\ndrag,stop\nPART NAME\nVAL1\nVAL2
      ;CHID\ndrag,step\nPART NAME\nVAL1\nVAL2
      ;CHID\drag,set\nPART NAME\nVAL1\nVAL2
      signal;CHID\nSIGNAL STRING\nSOURCE STRING
      message;CHID\nOPCODE ID\nstring\nSTRING1
      message;CHID\nOPCODE ID\nint\nINT1
      message;CHID\nOPCODE ID\nfloat\nFLOAT1
      message;CHID\nOPCODE ID\nstring_set\nSTRING1\nSTRING2\nSTRING3...
      message;CHID\nOPCODE ID\nint_set\nINT1\nINT2\nINT3...
      message;CHID\nOPCODE ID\nfloat_set\nFLOAT1\nFLOAT2\nFLOAT3...
      message;CHID\nOPCODE ID\nstring_int\nSTRING1\nINT1
      message;CHID\nOPCODE ID\nstring_float\nSTRING1\nFLOAT1
      message;CHID\nOPCODE ID\nstring_int_set\nSTRING1\nINT1\nINT2\nINT3...
      message;CHID\nOPCODE ID\nstring_float_set\nSTRING1\nFLOAT1\nFLOAT2\nFLOAT3...

iC[CHID]\n[cmd1][\r\n][cmd2][\r\n][cmd3]...
  = send a "command" (cmd1, cmd2, cmd3 etc.) to an existing named
    channel id "CHID". this can be a list of 1 or more command strings,
    with each string broken by a continuous sequence of 1 or more \r
    and/or \n characters. e.g. "\n", "\r", "\r\n", "\n\r",
    "\n\r\n\n\n", etc.

    commands understood are:

      text\nPART NAME\nTEXT STRING
        set the text of "PART NAME" to string "TEXT STRING"

      emit\nSIGNAL STRING\nSOURCE STRING
        emit signal "SIGNAL STRING" "SOURCE STRING"

      drag\nPART NAME\n[value|size|step|page]\nVAL1\nVAL2
        manipulate dragable of name "PART NAME" and either set "value",
        "size", "step" or "page" properties to "VAL1" and "VAL2" for x
        and y, where VAL1 and VAL2 are floating point values

      chid\nCHANNEL ID
        set the channel id of a given edje object (only valid in setup
        commands for the inline edje object) to "CHANNEL ID" so it can
        be addressed later.

      message\nOPCODE ID\n[string|int|float|string_set|int_set|...
      float_set|string|int|string_float|string_int_set|...
      string_float_set]\n[message data]
        send a message with opcode (integer) id "OPCODE ID" og one of
        the given types supported ("string", "int", "float", etc.) and
        then with the given "message data" at the end. message data
        format depends on message type:
        string:           STRING1
        int:              INT1
        float:            FLOAT1
        string_set:       STRING1\nSTRING2\nSTRING3...
        int_set:          INT1\nINT2\nINT3...
        float_set:        FLOAT1\nFLOAT2\nFLOAT3...
        string_int:       STRING1\nINT1
        string_float:     STRING1\nFLOAT1
        string_int_set:   STRING1\nINT1\nINT2\nINT3...
        string_float_set: STRING1\nFLOAT1\nFLOAT2\nFLOAT3...

ib
  = begin media replace sequence run

ie
